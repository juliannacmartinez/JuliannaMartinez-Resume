        <div class="subheading mb-5">Economics/Administrative Studies Major ðŸ“Š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second year college student at the University of California - Riverside. I chose to study economics because I really enjoyed the subject in high school. How that I am studying the subject more closely, I love it even more. I remember when I first took Intro to Microeconomics, I learned so much and has so much fun! I found it interesting how Economics mixes together mathematics, psychology, and sociology. In economics, we study people's decisions and why they make certain choices based on economic factors. Economics is the perfect center for all humanities. And since I'm not quite the best at math, economics uses pretty simple math that can be easily understood. Since my degree will be in economics and administrative studies, I hope to pursue a career in either data analysis, statistical analysis, or hospital administration. I like analyzing and interpreting information so I figured a career doing something like that would be quite enjoyable. My dream is too perhaps work for my favorite streaming platforms like Netflix, Spotify, or HBO Max and analyze streaming data. Yes, I do like movies as well. A job there would be PERFECT. I would also like to work in hospital administration because I feel like I would enjoy working on the business side of the medical field. I can work with numbers, NOT patients! I also believe I would strongly thrive at a managerial position. 
 <br><br>

        But for my own work experience; to be honest I have not had too much work experience because I'm 19 and hardly any job will give you a chance when you are first starting off. But, in high school, I was involved in ASB (Associated Student Body), or Leadership. In ASB, I would help organize our school's pep rallies, homecoming dances, fundraising events, and make large eye-catching posters. ASB was a great place where I learned proper organizational skills, time management, strengthened my communication skills, and how to collaborate successfully with my fellow peers and faculty. I was captain of my school's Varsity Girls Track & Field and Cross Country teams all four years. As team captains, I was always in charge of organizing team meetings, making sure our teams cooperate and work well together, lead team spirit, and made sure each and every one of my runners felt safe and apart of the team. I worked hard every day making sure our team worked to its greatest potential.
<br><br>

        But after high school, I worked an actual office job at a security company. I was an assistant to the Controller of the company. At the office, I created tons of Exel time sheets, organized employee files and checks, and collaborated with my coworkers every day. I even taught them shortcuts on the Exel application to make their work easier on them. With my experience in ASB, I excelled at this job because talking and working with strangers was so longer uncomfortable for me. I am so glad that being in ASB got me out of my shell. Unfortunately, I had to stop working at the office because I started to attend UC Riverside as a full time student in the fall of 2020.
